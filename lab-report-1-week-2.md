**Step 5: Setting an SHH Key:**

Make sure you are logged out ieng6. Since we are using windows just enter: ssh-keygen -t ed25519. When prompted to enter a file just hit *enter*. When prompted to enter a passphrase just hit *enter*.
Log back into ieng6. Once loged in enter mkdir .shh. Logout of ieng6. Then enter the following line into your terminal: /Users/(username)/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub cs15lsp22__@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/.ssh/authorized_keys. When prompted enter the password you've been using.
                                  
To make sure everything worked simply log back into ieng6 and you should be able to log in without having to enter a password.
                                  
The entire process should look like this:

**Step 6: Optimizing Remote Running:**
---
To cut down on things you have to enter into the terminal one thing is to enter the command you want to execute at the end of your ssh command in parenthesis.
                                  
For example: 
ssh cs15lsp22___@ieng6.ucsd.edu "ls"
